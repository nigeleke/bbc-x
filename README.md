Resurrection of the educational BBC-X assembler language used at Hatfield Polytechnic.

## Background

Back in 1973-1975 I was a student at Sir Fredric Osborn in WGC. At that time we were lucky enough to be able to use the DecSystem-10 facilities of the (then) Hatfield Polytechnic. Myself and a school friend used to bicycle over every Saturday morning to take advantage of as much time as possible. Both of us are now happily retired.

I'm now having a nostalgic recreation of some of the programs that I wrote during that time (I kept the line-printer listings all those years).

During those years we were taught a pseudo-assembly language known as BBC-X, to teach us low-level programming. This repository will collate whatever information I can elicit but, surprisingly, a Google search does not uncover very much.

## Quest

I believe the underlying BBC-X simulator was a BASIC program.

I'm hoping, on the very small off-chance that someone may have some documentation that would help with the above recreation.

Either, or both of, copies of a) the BASIC program, or b) a "Student/user guide to BBC-X" would be awesome. The eventual aim would be to run these on a PDP-10 emulator (https://obsolescence.wixsite.com/obsolescence/pidp10).

I hope someone can dust away the cobwebs and find something to help this quest. So far:

  1. I have already been in touch with the Uni of Herts to dig around their archives; they've been very helpful, but unfortunately weren't able to uncover anything...
  2. I have posted to the Facebook Hatfield Polytechnic Group; following up leads.

## History

BBC-X was written by Dr. Tagg for teaching purposes. Reading between the lines, it was potentially an assembler for a parallel hardware student project - written up in a thesis [here]( https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/bitstream/10044/1/21019/2/Tagg-W-1971-PhD-Thesis.pdf).

The BBC had a TV series about computing, but both BBC-X & BBC-10 seem to have been developed before the Beeb's programs and their famous [BBC Micro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Micro).
